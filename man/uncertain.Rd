\title{Uncertainty Analysis of Risk Maps}
\usage{
uncertain(rasters)
}
\arguments{
\item{rasters}{A Raster* object containing multiple risk maps.}
}
\value{
A Raster* object representing the standard deviation (uncertainty map).
}
\description{
Calculate the standard deviation across multiple risk maps with adjusted weights
to generate an uncertainty map.
}
\details{
This function aggregates risk maps where the weights have been adjusted, then computes
the standard deviation across these maps. The result is an uncertainty map that highlights areas
of high variability across the risk assessments.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
library(terra)
# Assuming risk maps are stored in a directory and have been adjusted post-OAT analysis
rasters <- terra::rast(dir("//all_risk_maps", full.names = TRUE))
uncertainty_map <- uncertain(rasters)
terra::plot(uncertainty_map)
}
}
